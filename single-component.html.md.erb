title: Understanding PCF Upgrades

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the order in which Ops Manager upgrades components and runs tasks during a full platform upgrade. It also explains how the scale of different PCF components affects uptime during upgrades, and which components are scalable. 

## <a id= "order"></a>Upgrade Order

When performing an upgrade, Ops Manager first upgrades individual components, and then runs one-time tasks.

1. The [Components](#components) section describes how Ops Manager upgrades PAS components and explains how individual component upgrades affect broader PAS capabilities.

2. The [One-Time Tasks](#tasks) section lists the tasks that Ops Manager runs after it upgrades the PAS components.

## <a id= "components"></a>Components

Ops Manager upgrades PAS components in a fixed order that honors component dependencies and minimizes downtime and other system limitations during the upgrade process.

The type and duration of limitations that you can expect during a PAS upgrade depend on how your components are scaled, and reflect the component upgrade order. 

### <a id= "single-components"></a>How Single-Component Scaling Affects Upgrades

In [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Ops Manager, the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile > **Resource Config** pane shows the components that the BOSH Director installs:

* **Scalable** component fields let you select the instance count from a range of settings or enter a custom value.
* **Unscalable** component fields allow a maximum of one instance.

When a component is scaled at a single instance, it can experience downtime and other limitations while the single VM restarts. This behavior might be acceptable for a test environment. To avoid downtime in a production environment, you should scale any scalable components, such as HAProxy, Router, and Diego cells, to more than one instance.

For more information about how the scale of each component affects upgrade behavior, see the [Upgrade Order and Limitations](#components-order-limit) table below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A full Ops Manager upgrade may take close to two hours, and you will have limited ability to deploy an application during this time.</p>

### <a id= "order-behavior"></a>Component Upgrade Order and Behavior

The table lists components in the order that Ops Manager upgrades each component. It also lists which components are scalable and explains how component downtime affects PAS app and control availability. The table includes the following columns:

* **Scalable**: Indicates whether the component has an editable value or a preconfigured and unchangeable value of one instance.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For components marked with a checkmark in this column, we recommend that you change the preconfigured instance value of 1 to a value that best supports your production environment. For more information about scaling a deployment, refer to the [Scaling Cloud Foundry topic](../concepts/high-availability.html).

* **Extended Downtime**: Indicates that if there is only one instance of the component, that component is unavailable for up to five minutes during an Ops Manager upgrade.

* **Downtime Affects...**: Indicates the plane of he PAS platform that component downtime affects, if the component is scaled at single instance:
  - **Apps**: Downtime affects app availability.
  - **Control Plane**: Apps remain available, but you cannot push, stage, or restart apps, or run other Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI) commands.

* **Other Limitations and Information**: Provides the following information:
    * Component availability, behavior, and usage during an upgrade
    * Guidance on disabling the component before an upgrade</p>
