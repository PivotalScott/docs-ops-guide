Role-based access control (RBAC) was added in Ops Manager v2.0 and is unavailable in older versions. 

Use RBAC to manage which operators in your organization can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in Ops Manager.

You must install Ops Manager v2.0 or later to use RBAC in Ops Manager.
