## <a id="import"></a> Import and Stage a Stemcell

![The Import Stemcell button is floated to the right of the Stemcell Library header next to the Save button](images/import-stemcell.png)

Download the appropriate `.tgz` stemcell file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf), then click **Import Stemcell** to permanently import a stemcell into Ops Manager.

![A modal that appears after importing a stemcell. The modal reads, **Select the products you want to stage**. The modal has a checkbox next to the product name. It also has a dismiss button and an Apply Stemcell to Products button](images/staging-modal.png)

To stage your stemcell to compatible products, enable the products in the **Import Stemcell** dialog. Click **Apply Stemcell to Products** to save your selections. Click **Dismiss** to dismiss the **Import Stemcell** dialog.


## <a id="version"></a> Choose a Stemcell Version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the dropdown in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

You can choose a different version until you deploy. After deployment, older stemcell versions are no longer available.

![The dropdown menu for a stemcell is displayed in the Staged column. Three versions are available.](images/opsman-view-available-stemcells.png)

If the stemcell displays with a green checkmark and the words **Latest stemcell** below the **Staged** dropdown, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell displays **Stemcell out-of-date**.

![Beneath the **Staged** version dropdown, a green checkmark next to the words **Latest stemcell** appears. The stemcell in this image is the latest available version.](images/opsman-latest-stemcell.png)
