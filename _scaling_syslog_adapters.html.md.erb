### Syslog Adapter

Syslog Adapter is a Loggregator component that manages user-provided syslog drains. This component should be scaled depending on the number of your drain bindings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A drain binding is a syslog destination associated with an app. Apps can have multiple bindings.</p>

Pivotal Application Service (PAS) recommends the following formula for determining the number of Syslog Adapter instances:

<p class="tip"><em>Number of Syslog Adapter instances = Total number of drain bindings * 2 / 500</em></p>

The syslog scheduler will assign each drain binding to two syslog adapters, therefore doubling the number of the totals. Each syslog adapter will be capable of servicing 500 drain bindings.

You can use the [`scheduler.drains`](../monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#scalable-syslog-ksi) and `scheduler.adapters` metrics to keep track of the scaling needs of Syslog Adapters.
