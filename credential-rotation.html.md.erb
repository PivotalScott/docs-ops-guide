<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic discusses rotating runtime CredHub encryption keys. Encryption keys are values that CredHub uses to obscure stored secrets. When an operator marks an additional key as primary, CredHub can rotate in that additional key as the encryption key. 

During this credential rotation process, the initial encryption key is used to access the hidden value. That value is then stored again by the additional encryption key.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you remove an encryption key and click <strong>Apply Changes</strong> before the rotation completes, the deployment enters a broken state. In this state, you can no longer access data stored with the deleted key.</p>

1. Select the **Primary** check box.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.


## <a id="verify"></a> Verify Elastic Runtime Encryption Key Rotation

To verify that the rotation completes, do the following:

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab.

1. Within the **CredHub** job, locate **Index 0**.

1. Within the **Logs** column, click the corresponding download icon.

1. Select the **Logs** tab.


1. Click the corresponding link to retrieve the downloaded log file.

1. Unzip the log file.

1. Unzip the larger of the two nested directories.

1. Ops Manager generates a compressed file for each CredHub virtual machine that exists on your deployment. Unzip each of these compressed files. 

1. Open the `credhub` directory.

1. Open the `credhub.log` file. If the Elastic Runtime credential rotation completed successfully, the CredHub log contains the following string: `Successfully rotated NUMBER-OF-CREDENTIALS items`

1. Remove the old encryption key.

1. Click the trashcan icon that corresponds to the old encryption key.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
